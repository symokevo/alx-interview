# Unlocking Boxes - README

This README provides an overview of the `canUnlockAll` method, which is designed to determine if all the boxes in a given list of lists can be opened. The method is implemented in Python and falls under the category of algorithms.

## Problem Description

You are faced with `n` number of locked boxes, each numbered sequentially from 0 to `n - 1`. The boxes are represented as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a box and may contain keys to other boxes. A key with the same number as a box can open that box. The first box, `boxes[0]`, is initially unlocked. The task is to determine whether it is possible to unlock all the boxes.

## Method Signature

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
```

The `canUnlockAll` method takes a single argument `boxes`, which is a list of lists representing the boxes and their respective keys.

## Approach

The method uses a greedy algorithm approach to unlock the boxes. It starts with the first box (`boxes[0]`), keeps track of the keys obtained, and iteratively explores the boxes using the available keys. If a box is encountered for which a key has been obtained, the box is considered unlocked, and its keys are added to the collection of available keys. This process continues until either all boxes are unlocked or there are no more keys to explore.

## Return Value

The `canUnlockAll` method returns `True` if it is possible to unlock all the boxes, indicating that every box can be opened. If it is not possible to unlock all the boxes, it returns `False`.

## Example Usage

```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 2], [3], [4], [2]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: False
```

In the first example, all the boxes can be opened since the keys in each box lead to the subsequent box. Therefore, the method returns `True`.

In the second example, the last box requires a key that is not available, preventing all boxes from being unlocked. Hence, the method returns `False`.

## Conclusion

The `canUnlockAll` method provides a solution to the problem of determining whether it is possible to unlock all the boxes in a given list of lists. By implementing a greedy algorithm approach, the method explores the boxes using the available keys to unlock as many boxes as possible. This method can be used to efficiently solve similar problems that involve unlocking boxes or exploring connected components.
