# Star Wars Character Printer - Node.js

This Node.js script fetches and prints the names of all characters from a Star Wars movie using the Star Wars API (`swapi-api.hbtn.io`). It takes a movie ID as a command-line argument and displays the characters from that movie.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script with the following command, providing a movie ID as an argument:

   ```bash
   ./starwars-characters.js 1
   ```

   Replace `1` with the desired movie ID.

## How it Works

The script utilizes the `request` library to make HTTP requests to the Star Wars API. It follows these steps:

1. Imports the required `request` library.
2. Defines a recursive function `req` that fetches and prints character names.
3. Makes an initial request to get the characters of the specified movie.
4. Calls the recursive function `req` to fetch and print character names.

## Important Notes

- Ensure you have Node.js and the `request` library installed (`npm install request`).
- This script assumes that the Star Wars API is available and responds as expected.
