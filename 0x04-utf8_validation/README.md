## Introduction

Welcome to the UTF-8 Validation repository! This readme file will guide you through UTF-8 validation using Python. UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that allows representing all possible Unicode characters.

## What is UTF-8 Validation

UTF-8 validation is the process of determining if a given byte sequence is a valid UTF-8 encoded string. It involves checking whether the bytes follow the UTF-8 encoding rules and represent valid Unicode characters.

## How UTF-8 Works

UTF-8 uses variable-length encoding, allowing it to represent different Unicode characters using one to four bytes. The encoding rules are as follows:

- A single-byte character starts with a 0 bit. The value of the byte is the Unicode code point.
- A multi-byte character starts with two or more high-order bits set to 1. The number of high-order bits indicates the total number of bytes in the character. The following bytes start with 10.

## Implementing UTF-8 Validation

To implement UTF-8 validation in Python, we need to check the bytes' pattern and ensure that they adhere to the UTF-8 encoding rules.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/utf8-validation.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd utf8-validation`
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended): [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) or [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) can be used.
4. Install project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Example

Here's a simple Python function to validate a byte sequence as UTF-8 encoded:

```python
def is_valid_utf8(byte_sequence):
    num_bytes = 0

    for byte in byte_sequence:
        if num_bytes == 0:
            if byte >> 5 == 0b110:
                num_bytes = 1
            elif byte >> 4 == 0b1110:
                num_bytes = 2
            elif byte >> 3 == 0b11110:
                num_bytes = 3
            elif byte >> 7 == 1:
                return False
        else:
            if byte >> 6 != 0b10:
                return False
            num_bytes -= 1

    return num_bytes == 0
```

The function checks if the given byte sequence adheres to UTF-8 encoding rules and returns `True` if it's a valid UTF-8 encoded string, otherwise False
